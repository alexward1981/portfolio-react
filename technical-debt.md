Any development tasks or optimisations which need to be made should be listed here.

**Note:** If there is a task/bug manager in place to cover this then this file will not be updated.

## Tasks:
1. Set up tests (jasmine and casperjs/spooky)

## Issues
1. Components don't load data very quickly. The state is undefined for a second until the api call has completed. I need to work out how to stop actions firing until that happens.
